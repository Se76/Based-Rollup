## SVM rollup
As part of the Turbin3 SVM cohort, our team built our own SVM rollup.
It fetches transactions, delegates funds via a Solana program, sends transactions to a sequencer, and processes them by locking accounts, loads and executes transactions, updating local state, and bundling similar transactions. Once a batch threshold is met (e.g., after 10 transactions), the rollup bundles them into one and settles the changes back on-chain.

## Overview
A rollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution that processes and bundles transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. This reduces congestion and fees while keeping the security of the underlying blockchain.

## Why would Solana need a rollup?
Rollups can enhance Solana by:
- **Increasing Throughput:** Offload transactions from the main chain.
- **Lower fees:** Batch transactions to lower costs.
- **Flexibility:** Allow for customized transaction processing without changing Solana’s core.

## Flow
1. **Fetches Transactions** 
2. **Delegates Funds:** Solana program
3. **Sends to the Sequencer**
4. **Locks accounts, Loads, and executes Transactions** 
5. **Updates Local State** 
6. **Bundles Similar Transactions:** Groups similar transactions into one.
7. **Batch(10) Bundling:** After 10 transactions, bundles them into a single transaction.
8. **Settles Changes to the Chain:** Commits batched changes back to Solana.

## Module Overview

**frontend.rs**  
  Actix Web
  - A submission endpoint (`/submit_transaction`) that accepts and forwards transactions to the sequencer.
  - A query endpoint (`/get_transaction`) that retrieves processed transactions from the rollup database.
  - A test endpoint to verify server functionality.

- **loader.rs**  
  Implements the account loader for the rollup. This module:
  - Fetches account data from Solana using RPC client.
  - Caches account data locally.
  - Implements the `TransactionProcessingCallback` required by SVM API
    
- **main.rs**  
  Entry point for the application. It:
  - Sets up communication channels, using crossbeam and async channels.
  - Creates threads for the sequencer and rollup database.
  - Runs the Actix server, tying all modules together.

- **processor.rs**  
  Provides helper functions to configure and initialize the SVM API’s transaction batch processor. 
It:
  - Implements a fork graph (required by the processor).
  - Sets up the processor’s program cache with built-in programs (system and BPF loader).

- **rollupdb.rs**  
  Implements an in-memory database that manages:
  - Account states and locked accounts.
  - Processed transactions.
  - Communication with the frontend by retrieving transactions based on requests.  
  It handles locking and unlocking accounts as transactions are processed.

- **sequencer.rs**  
  Acts as the transaction sequencer and processor. It:
  - Receives transactions via a crossbeam channel.
  - Locks accounts for parallel execution.
  - Uses Solana’s SVM API to process and validate transactions.
  - Batches transactions (every 10 transactions) and settles when the threshold is reached.

- **settle.rs**  
  Contains the functionality to settle state changes on Solana. Creates and sends a proof transaction via Solana’s RPC, comitting updates to SVM.
