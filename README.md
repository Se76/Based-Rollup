## Overview
A rollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution that processes and bundles transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. This reduces congestion and fees while keeping the security of the underlying blockchain.

## Why would Solana need a rollup?
Rollups can enhance Solana by:
- **Increasing Throughput:** Offload transactions from the main chain.
- **Lower fees:** Batch transactions to lower costs.
- **Flexibility:** Allow for customized transaction processing without changing Solanaâ€™s core.

## Features
- **Fetches Transactions:** 
- **Delegates Funds:** Solana program
- **Sends to the Sequencer:**
- **Locks accounts, Loads, and executes Transactions:** 
- **Updates Local State:** 
- **Bundles Similar Transactions:** Groups similar transactions into one.
- **Batch Bundling:** After 10 transactions, bundles them into a single unit.
- **Settles Changes to the Chain:** Commits batched changes back to Solana.
