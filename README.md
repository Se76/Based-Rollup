## Overview
A rollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution that processes and bundles transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. This reduces congestion and fees while keeping the security of the underlying blockchain.

## Why Rollups for Solana?
Rollups can greatly enhance Solana by:
- **Increasing Throughput:** Offload transactions from the main chain.
- **Reducing Fees:** Batch transactions to lower costs.
- **Offering Flexibility:** Allow for customized transaction processing without changing Solanaâ€™s core.

## Features
- **Fetches Transactions:** Efficiently retrieves incoming transactions.
- **Delegates Funds:** Uses a dedicated Solana program to manage fund delegation.
- **Sends to the Sequencer:** For ordered and structured processing.
- **Locks, Loads, and Executes Transactions:** Ensures data integrity during processing.
- **Updates Local State:** Keeps the current state updated with processed transactions.
- **Bundles Similar Transactions:** Groups similar transactions into one.
- **Batch Bundling:** After 10 transactions, bundles them into a single unit.
- **Settles Changes to the Chain:** Commits batched changes back to Solana.
